Load Balancer (HAProxy Cluster):

This box represents the two instances of HAProxy configured as a cluster.
Draw arrows pointing towards the web server and application server boxes to indicate that the load balancer distributes traffic to them.
Connect the two HAProxy instances with a line to represent their clustering and synchronization.
Web Server:

This box represents the server hosting the web application.
Draw arrows pointing towards it from the load balancer box to indicate that it receives web traffic.
Optionally, you can draw multiple instances of the web server if you're deploying them for scalability.
Application Server:

This box represents the server hosting the application logic.
Draw arrows pointing towards it from the load balancer box to indicate that it receives application traffic.
Connect this box to the database server box to represent the interaction between the application and database servers.
Database Server:

This box represents the server hosting the database.
Draw arrows pointing towards it from the application server box to indicate that it is accessed by the application server.
Optionally, you can represent replication or backup connections if you have multiple instances or backup mechanisms in place.
Label each box with the corresponding component name (Load Balancer, Web Server, Application Server, Database Server) and possibly include additional details such as IP addresses or server names for clarity.

This visual representation helps in understanding how the components are connected and how traffic flows within the system. You can use any diagramming tool like Lucidchart, draw.io, or even hand-draw the diagram if needed.
